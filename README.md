# RandomPlacement
The goal of this small project is to explore different methods of putting objects in an array in an even random distribution. This is for the Hivolts project where fences, mhos, and the player were placed randomly on a 2-dimensional array. Previously, objects were placed randomly, and if the spot was already occupied, it would chose another one at random until it found an empty spot.
